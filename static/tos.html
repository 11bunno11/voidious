          </li>
          <li>
            The safest way to use Interstellar is by using its official deployments or by
            <a href="https://docs.gointerstellar.app/windows-local"
              >hosting Interstellar on your own machine</a
            >.

        </ul>
        <h2>Section 2.1: Summary - Offical Interstellar Deployment</h2>
        <p>
          Official Interstellar deployments are run with privacy in mind.
          <b
            >We do temporarily collect and retain some PII such as IP addresses used to access
            the official Interstellar deployment, but this is not intentional.</b
          >
        </p>
        <h2>Section 2.2: Summary - Unofficial Interstellar Deployments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Interstellar developers are commited to ensuring Interstellar remains as a secure
            application. However, we cannot guarantee the same level of security or privacy of
            unofficial Interstellar deployments.
          </li>
          <li>
            The type of information collected on community deployments is completely dependent
            on who and where the deployment is being hosted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generally, we recommend Interstellar deployment operators to collect as minimal
            information as possible.
          </li>
          <li>We cannot control unofficial Interstellar deployments.</li>
          <li>
            We cannot verify the authenticity of the code in unofficial Interstellar
            deployments. This is an extremely rare situation, but we will not be held
            responsible if your data such as an account becomes compromised as a result of
            malicious code in an unofficial Interstellar deployment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Section 3: Acceptable Use</h1>
        <p>
          Do not use any Interstellar deployment to do illegal activity. If you are under 18,
          do not use any Interstellar deployment to access any adult sites.
        </p>

        <h1>Section 5: The information we collect</h1>
        <h2>Section 5.1: The official Interstellar deployment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information that may be unintentionally collected as part of using Interstellar's
            official deployment may include basic information such as your IP address, web
            traffic when using Interstellar, etc. This information is temporary and is kept
            until the server is rebooted.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not purposefully collect anyone's information. We try to limit the data
            collected by the official Interstellar deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not, will not, and will never knowingly collect the information of minors
            under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by laws in your country).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Section 5.2: Unofficial Interstellar Deployments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We can't give a definitive answer on what information is collected when you use a
            unofficial Interstellar deployment, only the operator of the Interstellar
            deployment you're using can.
          </li>
          <li>
            We urge operators to collect and store as minimal information as possible, but we
            can't control what they do.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Section 6: Control</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We do not have the power to control what unofficial Interstellar deployment
            operators do with their deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            We protect information stored on the official Interstellar deployment by limiting
            access. The only person that has access to the server of which the official
            Interstellar deployment runs on is the server host and the owner of Interstellar,
            xbubbo.
          </li>
          <li>
            We cannot check every deployment for malicious code. If any data such as your
            account gets compromised after you access it on a unofficial Interstellar
            deployment, we will not be held liable.
          </li>

        <h1>
          Section 7: How we use basic information on the official Interstellar deployment that
          may be collected accidentally
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your IP address is used to allow you to use the Interstellar service. This is how
            it works for every website you visit, not just Interstellar. The difference is
            whether or not this data is intentionally collected and stored.
          </li>
          <li>
            Info about your web traffic while using Interstellar is needed to allow you to
            access the service you wish to access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interstellar will NEVER sell your info to third-parties, other than to some ad
            companies. We do this so we can make enough money to pay for our server.
          </li>
          <li>
            The official Interstellar server operator may respond to legal requests and assist
            law enforcement officials in legal investigations if ever needed. We can't
            guarantee we'll always have information to hand out as the information that may be
            collected is automatically destroyed on reboot, but if we do still have information
            relevent to the investigation, we may provide law enforcement officials with it.
            Please redirect all requests regarding data with an unofficial Interstellar
            deployment to its operator, as we don't have control over unofficial deployments
            and couldn't comply with requests even if we wanted to.
